== Build It

For the tooling setup, follow the bundle or NPM pre-req's https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/#prerequisites

I chose Bundler for this presentation.
If you want to build this, run
`# bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs trouble-with-troubleshooting.adoc` to build it to html.
