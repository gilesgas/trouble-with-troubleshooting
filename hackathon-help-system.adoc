[[original_idea]]
== The Original Idea

image::hawkular.svg[background, size=contain]

[.step]
* Field help and long form docs.
* Provisioned using open source tooling.
* Written in AsciiDoc.
* Mapped to pages and fields with `.yml` or `.json`.
* Live rendered using `asciidoctor.js` on demand.

[[challenge]]
== The Challenge

Product not designed for atomic content linking.

[.step]
* URL slugs not implemented for page element atomicity.
* Fields not uniquely or consistently identified.

[[hackathon]]
== The Hackathon Solution

image::goal-clipart.svg[background, size=contain]

  * Implement an embedded help solution inside Manage.
  * Display rendered help content in a new tab when you click a Help Button.
  * You have two days.

[[mvp]]
=== MVP

[.step]
* Give users access to docs inside the product.
* Do it using open source technology.
* Make the content single source.
* Make everything automatic.
* Separate docs releases from code releases.

[[technology]]
=== Technology

* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/[Asciidoctor] source content.
* https://middlemanapp.com/[Middleman] Static Site Builder.
* https://github.com/bryanbraun/franklin[Franklin] Static Site Framework.
* GitLab on-premise hosted.

[[url_matching]]
=== URL Matching

* Help pages named the same as the PHP page to document.
* index.php > index.adoc > index.html
* Javascript button loaded files from a pre-set location in webroot.

[[watcher]]
=== Watcher script

.`update-newadmin-docs.sh`
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -d /docs/ ]; then
	git clone ssh://git@gitlab:12345/docs/embedded-docs.git /docs/
fi
cd /docs/ && \
	git pull && \
	git reset --hard HEAD && \
	rsync --delete-after -a /docs/build/ /var/www/docs/
sleep 300
----

[.step]
* Resides in the tools directory of the app webroot
* Watches for changes per the `sleep` interval
* If changes are detected, sync the html from Git to `/var/www/docs`
* Sleep and repeat.
