== Troubleshooting

Everything malfunctions eventually.

When it does you rely on troubleshooting sections in docs to solve your problems.

== Troubleshooting done right

Troubleshooting steps should do the following:

* Re-assure you that "you've got this"
* Give you just enough info to solve the problem
* Be mindful of your mental state
* Give you a path when troubleshooting fails.

=== !

When done well you get users reacting like this:

== Troubleshooting done wrong

When troubleshooting is not done well...

=== It causes frustration

=== Support calls

=== No love on the internets for your business

== Why does troubleshooting often fail?

* You don't understand how your audience scans your docs.
* You don't focus on symptoms.
* You don't consider how they might be feeling at the time.
* You don't solve their problem!

== The trouble with blenders

When they work, they are fantastic.

When they stop half-way through a blend...

You want to do this to them...

Huh? What's this about Interlock herbidy glerbity blerty blergh

== Why did these steps fail for me?

* Couldn't find the symptom: "flashing status light"
* Didn't emphathise with my mental state: "frustrated"
* Used Jargon: "Interlock Protection" (dude WTF),
* ...blender will need to be reset if the interlock is not properly engaged.

=== How I was feeling after reading this

"Reset the flamin' blender?"

"How long is that going to take"

"They're getting a frickin' email about this X-("

"Guess I'm having granola for breakfast..."

== I sent them an email...

It took them two days to get back to me.

They asked me for my serial number?

What does that have to do with status lights?

Frustration > Indifference > TECH WRITING!!!!

== I sent them revised copy

=== Symptom

Blender Light Is Flashing

=== Condition

The status light on your blender blinks at different rates (slow, solid, fast).

This happens when the blender bowl interlock or temperature sensors detect a problem.

=== Solution

You can often solve these problems by reading the explanation and troubleshooting steps for each light sequence on page 8 of this manual.

=== If all else fails

If you still have problems with your blender after troubleshooting the issue, contact Customer Support through the numbers and methods in the back of your manual.

== Do it right, or don't do it

Troubleshooting is useless if it doesn't help your customers solve problems in their language.

Talk to your users.

Understand their needs.

Fix their problems.

== Say G'day
